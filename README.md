# hello-world
My first repository

## Using GIT from a local machine

I have done the following:

  1. Created an SSH key and added it to GitHub
  2. Cloned this project to my local machine
  3. Pushed my first commit successfully!

Now, I am going to add a new file 'helloWorld.py' and I am going to add this new file to the project using GIT.
