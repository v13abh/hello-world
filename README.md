# hello-world
My first repository

## Using GIT from a local machine

I have done the following:

  1. Created an SSH key and added it to GitHub
  2. Cloned this project to my local machine
  3. Pushed my first commit successfully!
  4. Added a new file to the project and pushed
  5. Realized that my GitHub account email and my GIT commit email were different
  6. Changed primary email on GitHub so my commits will register under my name
  7. Created an experimental branch and modified a file.
